Description

In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital marketing, businesses strive to drive traffic to their websites to maximize consumer engagement with website content and for online retailers also promote sales. Display advertising is one method used to drive traffic. Success of a display ad is judged by the percentage of visitors who click on the ad, commonly known as Click-Through Rate (CTR). The goal of this competition is to predict CTR based on a set of variables describing the quality, relevance, type, target audience, and content of the display advertisement.
